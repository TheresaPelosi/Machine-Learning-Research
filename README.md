# Machine-Learning-Research
This is my first experience with machine learning and genetic algorithms. I created this project to become more familiar 
with the concepts associated with both.

<b>What I've done so far:</b> I have created the general structure for the genetic algorithm and have all of the necessary classes.
I am able to move through generations and learn from previous generations.

<b>What I still need to do:</b> Learn accurate information from past generations efficiently so that I move to the goal.

<b>What I'm currently working on:</b> Figuring out why after generation 3 learning stagnates.
